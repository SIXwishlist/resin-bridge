# resin-bridge

A simple setup to bridge `wlan0` to `eth0`, and thus share the device's Wi-Fi
connection with the devices plugged into it over Ethernet.

This code has been tested with Raspberry Pi 3.

The setup is based on [Bridging Network Connections with Proxy ARP](https://wiki.debian.org/BridgeNetworkConnectionsProxyArp)
from the Debian Wiki.
